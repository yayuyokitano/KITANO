# KITANO

Installation instructions:
1. Download the repo
2. Run `yarn install` in the installation folder to install dependencies (about 300MB)
3. Run `yarn start` to start the application

In order to make the application work properly you will have to drag the appropriate 7za file from node_modules/7zip-bin to the .webpack/main/native_modules folder.
This should be automated. It's not. Too bad!
